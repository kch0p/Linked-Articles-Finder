# Linked-Articles-Finder
Finds all of the articles hyperlinked within a given URL, and then opens a new tab that clearly lists their titles/urls for you. Inspired by the need to quickly review all of the materials referenced in resource-dense articles like [this one](https://www.slowboring.com/p/racism-is-a-big-deal) by Matthew Yglesias.
